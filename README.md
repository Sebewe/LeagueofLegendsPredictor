### Problem Identification
We will be predicting, at the 15 minute mark, if a League of Legends team wins or loses the game. I chose 15 minutes as the line to draw for a couple of reasons:
 - Tower plates fall at 14 minutes.
  - Tower plates can be a massive source of income in the early game.
  - Tower plates are a representation of the early game laning pressure a team has.
  - Once tower plates fall, laners are more likely to roam since they aren't risking giving up plate gold. This implies a possible change in the tide of the game if a team is playing an efficient roaming composition.
 - You cannot start a surrender vote before 15 minutes
  - If my model is accurate enough, I can feel justified for giving up at 15 minutes since the game is already predicted to be unwinnable. 
 - Some betting platforms allow you to withdraw a bet partway through the game for a penalty.
  - This means that if my model is accurate enough, it opens an avenue for me to abuse this tactic and gain favorable gambling odds. 


##### Model Requirements Details
This is a __binary classification problem__, therefore my model will either classify _win_ or _lose_. My evaluation metric will be accuracy. I chose accuracy because I'm most concerned with knowing the outcome of a game. Other evaluation metrics, such as recall or precision, tailor the score towards accurately predicting a certain outcome more correctly than the other. I am purely interested in accurately modelig __if__ the team will win, and am not concerned that one specific classification may be more accurate than the other. All data used in training and prediction can be collected at the 15 minute mark. This means that if you deployed the model in the real world, it would be able to predict a winner at the 15 minute mark, given you have the necessary numbers on in-game data.

#### Discussion
The baseline model was a Support Vector Classifer. I chose this model because of it's ability to work well in high dimensions. I knew that there were tons of features I'd end up throwing into the model, and I was afraid that the wrong model would suffer from the _curse of dimensionality_.  This model, on the default parameters, achieved a test accuracy of 72.99%, and a training accuracy of 72.28%. This was a decent result, and suggested that the model was already very effective at making predictions. I believe this is because XP and Gold are sort of all-encompassing representations of a team's performance. This being said, I was still curious about how accurate I could get the model with these simple metrics. I decided to run a __grid-search__ to hypertune the `C` parameter. It only raised the accuracy by 1%. Since this isn't a noticeable increase, and is likely just due to a different fitting to noise, I decided to leave my baseline model with the default parameter of `C=1`. In totality, I believe that this is a __good__ model. It truly testifies to how impactful a few seemingly simple features can be.

### Final Model

__Note:__ In preparation for this model, I wanted to one-hot encode the champions that a team had. This meant combining data from the two DataFrames, and resulted in a new train-test split. The accuracies you see above in __Baseline Model__ are from the new split.

##### Feature Discussion

I chose to add the features on opponent data beause I believe it would give more insight into how well the team was performing. It would allow the model to understand more about the difference in team strength. For example if a game had a level 1 invade, and resulted in a spiral of high-action gameplay with many deaths/kills early in the game, the model would understand that __both__ teams have high kills. This allows for a more nuanced expression of metrics like gold and exp. Adding the champion data allows for the model to account for comps which may be hyperscalers. For example, if a team has Kayle and Veigar, they may be down gold in the early game. However, the model should understand that sometimes it is __expected__ for a champion or team composition to be weak earlier in the match, with the guarentee of becoming incredibly strong if the game goes on long enough. In situations like this, it may be more acceptable to allow for a larger difference in our other metrics between teams. Finally, I added data on the tower plates collected on a team. I covered why this can be impactful in the introduction, but to briefly summarize: tower plates are effectively representations of how much pressure was exerted on lanes through the first 14 minutes. They are a way of showing early game lane advantages even if cs and exp are similar.     

##### SVC Model

The first model trained on this new dataset was another __SVC__ model. It achieved a __train accuracy__ of 75.88% and a __test accuracy__ of 75.11%. While this is marginally better than the last, I was not satisfied with such a small increase. However, I reasoned that since my model was trying to predict what would happen over the course of a game purely based off of the first 15 minutes, a high accuracy would likely represent over fitting. To expand on this, League of Legends is a game where despite the lead a team has, if they begin to perform poorly it opens the possibility of the losing team taking the lead. Additionally, as discussed before, certain team compositions are expected to fall behind early game, with the understanding that they scale better into the late game. These unknowable possibilites makes it so that a model with an accuracy of, for example, 98% would be overfit to the data. The reality is, my model __should__ have a degree of uncercainty, because no League of Legends game is ever determined until one team wins. Despite this, I still wanted to examine performance with another model.    
     
The next model I trained on this data was a __Random Forest Classifier__. It had a similar test accuracy (74.81%), however it's train accuracy was 100%. This is because I initially trained this model with default hyperparameters. Random Forest, if not bounded, will always attempt to perfectly fit the data. The reason it was able to do so with my data is because of the one-hot encoding of the champions. Across 21000 games, it is already rare for the same team composition to be chosen twice, and furthermore practically impossible for a game to have the same team composition __and__ nearly identical aggregrate performances at 15 minutes. These two traits of the data allow the RFC to perfectly 'bin' each observation. Obviously, a training accuracy of 100% is not acceptable since we need the ability to generalize to unseen data. To correct for this, I performed a __k-fold grid search__ on the `__max_depth__` hyperparameter. Mean validation accuracy from 4 different folds was examined for 14 different max_depths, for a total of 56 models being trained. This resulted in an __optimal `max_depth` of 30__. This RFC had a mean validation accuracy (similar to train accuracy when performing k-fold validation) of 74.56% and a test accuracy of 74.85%. Despite being _technically_ worse than the new SVC model, I believe the RFC is preferable due to it's low computational complexity and insignificant difference in performace. For those reasons __the RFC was chosen to be my final model__. Also, this model would theoretically be better at predicting the outcome of games with team compositions that are built to scale into lategame, or games where an early lead was only represented primarily through lane pressure. Additionally, it should have a more accurate prediction for games that have extreme observations for categories like kills, gold, or exp (given that the values are roughly equal between each team). This conclusion arises from the previous explanation of the features and why they were added.    
      
### Fairness Analysis

In order to formulate a fairness question, I decided to examine the __confusion matrix__ of my final model.

![Confusiom Matrix](confusion_matrix.png)

Looking at this confusion matrix, it appears my model is almost equally accurate for both classifications. This is likely because I am passing in enemy performance data as well. It is very likely that the victor of the game is predicted mainly by which team has a higher gold and exp value.
